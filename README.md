# Calculator
A simple calculator with a Tk GUI, written in python

So far the calculator does not accept consecutive operations and is only meant to be used for simple calculations, like '51 + 227' or '144*31'. In case one tries to use an unsupported operation the screen prints a simple 'Err' indication.
